# DEVELOPMENT
# =============================================================================
# Code projects and development environment
#
# KEY CONCEPT: AIfred is a "hub" that knows about projects but doesn't contain them.
# Your actual code lives elsewhere (e.g., ~/Code). AIfred tracks and orchestrates.

development:
  # Where you clone/create code projects (NOT inside AIfred)
  projects_root: "~/Code"

  # Optional: Creative/writing projects (separate from code)
  # creative_root: "~/CreativeProjects"

  # Naming conventions for new projects
  conventions:
    naming: "lowercase-with-dashes"  # e.g., "my-new-project"
    # Options: lowercase-with-dashes, snake_case, PascalCase

  # Registered projects (populated by /create-project or manually)
  projects:
    # example_project:
    #   path: "~/Code/example-project"
    #   type: "web-app"              # web-app, api, library, cli, docker, other
    #   language: "typescript"
    #   repo: "github.com/user/repo"
    #   status: "active"             # active, maintenance, archived
    #   context_file: ".claude/context/projects/example-project.md"
    #   notes: "Description of what this project does"
