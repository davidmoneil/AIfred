# Projects

**Purpose**: Project development workspaces — where Jarvis' creative work lives.

**Layer**: Body (projects)

## Project Aion

Project Aion is special — it's Jarvis working on himself.
Contains: designs, ideas, plans, progress, reports, experiments, evolution.

See `project-aion/` for full structure.

## External Projects

External project workspaces go in `project-aion/external/`:
```
project-aion/external/<project-name>/
├── context.md
├── sessions/
└── decisions.md
```

The actual project codebase stays in `/Users/aircannon/Claude/<ProjectName>/`.

## Key Principle

**Deliverables stay separate from planning.**
- Planning/progress → here
- Codebase → external location
