# Experiments

**Purpose**: Experimental work, prototypes, and proof-of-concept implementations.

---

## Structure

| Directory | Contents |
|-----------|----------|
| `current/` | Active experiments |
| `archive/` | Completed experiments |

## What Belongs Here

- Proof-of-concept implementations
- A/B comparison tests
- Prototype code
- Experimental configurations

## What Does NOT Belong Here

- Experiment results → `reports/`
- Production implementations → appropriate location in `/.claude/`
- Design specifications → `designs/`

## Lifecycle

1. **Setup**: Create experiment directory in `current/`
2. **Execute**: Run experiment, capture data
3. **Report**: Document results in `reports/`
4. **Archive**: Move experiment to `archive/`
5. **Adopt**: If successful, implement properly in production location
