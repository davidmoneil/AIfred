# JICM Submission Method Test Results
# 2026-02-03 - Full Test Run

## Working Methods
METHOD_1=SUCCESS  # C-m (Standard Enter)
METHOD_2=SUCCESS  # -l $'\r' (Literal CR)
METHOD_5=SUCCESS  # Enter (tmux Enter key)

## Failed Methods
METHOD_3=FAILED   # -l $'\n' (Literal LF)
METHOD_4=FAILED   # -l $'\r\n' (Literal CRLF)
METHOD_6=FAILED   # Escape C-m (Escape + Enter)
METHOD_7=FAILED   # C-m C-m (Double Enter)

## Recommendations
RECOMMENDED=1
RECOMMENDED_DESC=C-m (Standard Enter)

## Key Observations
- CR-based methods work: C-m, literal CR, Enter
- LF-based methods fail: literal LF, CRLF
- Multi-step methods fail: Escape+Enter, Double Enter
- Ad hoc Bash script (separate text + C-m calls) FAILED
- Test script (same pattern) SUCCEEDED

## Hypothesis to Test
The difference may be in how the text and submission are combined.
Test script sends text, sleeps 0.2s, then sends submit.
Ad hoc script may have timing or signal delivery issues.

Possible factors:
1. Single tmux send-keys call with text+CR combined
2. Timing between text send and submit send
3. Shell execution context differences
