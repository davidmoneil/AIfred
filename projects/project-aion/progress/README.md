# Progress

**Purpose**: Development session records and milestone completion documentation.

**Scope**: Tracking the actual work done — deviations, decisions, session logs.

## Structure

| Directory | Contents |
|-----------|----------|
| `current/sessions/` | Active session logs and work records |
| `current/milestones/` | Milestone completion records |
| `archive/` | Historical progress documentation |

## What Belongs Here

- Session work logs (e.g., `2026-01-22-organization-findings.md`)
- Milestone completion records
- Deviation notes from planning docs
- Work-in-progress documentation

## What Does NOT Belong Here

- Design specifications → `designs/`
- Implementation plans → `plans/`
- Major survey/review work → `reports/`

## Relationship to Planning Docs

When work deviates from planning docs:
1. Note the deviation in the relevant `progress/` document
2. Link from the planning doc to the progress doc
3. Update planning doc checkboxes when work completes

## Lifecycle

1. **Session Start**: Create session log if significant work expected
2. **During Work**: Document decisions, blockers, learnings
3. **Session End**: Finalize log, update planning docs
4. **Archive**: After milestone/project completion, move to `archive/`
