# External Projects

**Purpose**: Development workspaces for projects outside of Jarvis/Project Aion.

---

## Structure

```
external/
└── <project-name>/
    ├── context.md      # Project context summary
    ├── sessions/       # Session work logs
    └── decisions.md    # Key decisions made
```

## Key Principle

**Deliverables stay separate from planning.**

- Project codebase → `/Users/aircannon/Claude/<ProjectName>/`
- Development workspace → `projects/project-aion/external/<project-name>/`

## What Belongs Here

- Project context summaries
- Session logs for work on external projects
- Decision records
- Planning notes

## What Does NOT Belong Here

- The actual project codebase
- Project deliverables
- Production artifacts
