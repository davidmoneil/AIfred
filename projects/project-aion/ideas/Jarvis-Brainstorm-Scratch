Jarvis-Brainstorm-Scratch

###########
Homemade skills, skills directly imported from github, etc -> Need a simlar treatment for Progresive Disclosure and Intelligent Selection standards as the decomposed plugins.  See e.g. "I see that mcp-validation and session-management don't have the new frontmatter format (they're older skills from before this PR). That's fine - they're existing skills that work." This is too much of a functional gloss.  When a discrepancy is identified, make note, don't assume it's fine, and add it to a backlog of future potential PRs.

What session life-sycle stages exist and what reproducible events should be triggered o what conditions?

*Session Start
	check AIfred, adopt/adapt/reject
	Jarvis should automatically provide a selectable list or:
		1. continue with last session's work? -> Jarvis reads last session, reads relevant project docs, loads design patterns into context, makes a plan, replies to user for approval/input
		2. continue with a specific session id or conversatoin name? -> Jarvis reads named session, reads relevant project docs, loads design patterns into context, makes a plan, replies to user for approval/input
		3. custom instructions
			a) switch to a new project (there's no session IDs, etc) -> Jarvis prompts the user for the info needed to set up new project space
			b) switch to an existing project (for which there's not a session ID or named chat, but Jarvis looks for a session-state or checkpoint) -> Jarvis reads session state and/or checkpoint, reads relevant project docs, loads design patterns into context, makes a plan, replies to user for approval/input
			c) custom prompt -> Jarvis creates plan to address prompt, makes a scratch space for session outputs if needed (example: user wants to work specifically on Jarvis ecosystem improvement)

	Upon new session Jarvis shouldn't ever just sit there waiting for a prompt
	New session triggers watcher script

*Delegation/Persistance
	Jarvis delegates based on session plan (the WHOLE session was planned during session startup)
	Follows up if/when agents think the job is done
	Jarvis evaluates and triggers wiggum loop if unsatisfied
	Repeat until Jarvis is happy
	Jarvis manages context

*Report/Review
	Jarvis summarizes completed work for the session
	User gives feedback
	Jarvis evaluates additional work needed
	Jarvis plans and delegates
	OR Jarvis and User agree that session work is satisfactory
	User requests end session

*Session End
	Jarvis reviews delegated agentic work for efficiency, completeness and accuracy
	Jarvis reviews interactions with user
	Jarvis reviews Jarvis' planning, decision-making, context management
	Jarvis derives insights and distills into design pattern improvements
	Jarvis applies improvements
	Session state updated
  	Priorities updated
  	Checkpoint created
  	MCPs enabled reset to Tier 1 (no need for auto-clear, just reset)
  	Version bump
  	Changes committed
  	Pushed to Project_Aion branch
  	User exits


###############
I want a /Jarvis command.  All it does is bring up a menu of my commonly used manual commands.  There are so many commands now, I don't want to remember them or cycle through long list anymore.  Include /context /context-budget /context-checkpoint /end-session /smart-compact /health-report /setup /setup-readiness /sync-aifred-baseline /tooling-health /validate-mcp /clear /compact /config /doctor /export /plan /rename /resume /stats /todos /usage

...but could you make the selection list sorted alphabetically?

CURRENTLY NOT WORKING


###############
I want Jarvis to know the weather and the date/time at startup.  He should say something politely conversational at session start.  A session start hook should trigger a prompt to be submitted to him right at initialization of the terminal.


##############
For context budget estimation, maybe there should just be a somewhat constant trigger for /context and then a check by the model or script parse, puts the updated contex size into an env var, when if that env var value is >x then the context compression command is invoked.


##############
Need to critically review the pocesses and triggers that manage session starts, mcp loading/unloading from context (probably the buggiest), context budgeting and compression, self-reflection (not in place yet), project space cleaning, end session, etc
