**Purpose**: Active design specifications and architecture documents for Project Aion development.

**Scope**: Committed designs that guide implementation — not exploratory ideas.

## Structure

| Directory | Contents |
|-----------|----------|
| `current/` | Active designs being implemented or referenced |
| `archive/` | Completed or superseded designs |

## What Belongs Here

- Phase-level design documents (e.g., `phase-6-autonomy-design.md`)
- Architecture specifications
- System design documents
- Design decision records

## What Does NOT Belong Here

- Exploratory ideas → `ideas/`
- Implementation plans → `plans/`
- Execution results → `reports/`

## Lifecycle

1. **Create**: New design starts in `current/`
2. **Implement**: Design guides development work
3. **Complete**: When fully implemented, move to `archive/` with completion date
4. **Supersede**: If replaced by new design, archive with "superseded by" note
