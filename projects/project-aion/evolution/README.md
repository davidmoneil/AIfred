# Evolution

**Purpose**: Self-improvement work streams for Jarvis development.

**Scope**: Both external-driven (AIfred sync) and internal-driven (self-improvement) evolution work.

## Structure

| Directory | Contents |
|-----------|----------|
| `aifred-integration/` | AIfred baseline sync work, porting, integration |
| `self-improvement/` | Jarvis-initiated improvements from reflection cycles |

## AIfred Integration

Work related to keeping Jarvis current with the AIfred baseline:
- `chronicle.md` — Master progress document with reasoning
- `roadmap.md` — Integration milestones and sessions
- `recommendations.md` — Analysis and recommendations
- `port-log.md` — Record of adopt/adapt/reject decisions
- `sync-reports/` — Historical sync analysis documents

## Self-Improvement

Work generated from Jarvis' autonomic self-improvement cycles:
- Proposals from AC-05 Self-Reflection
- Implementation work from AC-06 Self-Evolution
- Research discoveries from AC-07 R&D Cycles

## Key Principle

The **ability** to evolve lives in `/.claude/` (components, patterns).
The **records** of evolution work live here in Project Aion.
