# Self-Improvement

**Purpose**: Jarvis-initiated improvements from autonomic reflection and evolution cycles.

---

## Contents

| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `proposals/` | Improvement proposals generated by AC-05/AC-07 |
| `completed/` | Implemented improvements with results |

## Source Systems

- **AC-05 Self-Reflection**: Analyzes patterns, mistakes, blockers
- **AC-06 Self-Evolution**: Implements approved proposals
- **AC-07 R&D Cycles**: Discovers external improvements

## Workflow

1. Reflection cycle generates proposal
2. Proposal enters evolution queue (`/.claude/state/queues/evolution-queue.yaml`)
3. Evolution cycle implements when appropriate
4. Results documented here
5. Learnings feed back to `/.claude/context/lessons/`

## Key Principle

This directory tracks the **work** of self-improvement.
The **capability** to self-improve lives in `/.claude/context/components/`.
The **operational outputs** live in `/.claude/reports/`.
