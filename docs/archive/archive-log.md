| **Original Path** | `/Users/aircannon/Claude/Jarvis/docs/PROJECT-PLAN.md` |
| **Archived Path** | `/Users/aircannon/Claude/Jarvis/docs/archive/PROJECT-PLAN.md` |
| **Reason** | Obsolete - superseded by Project Aion roadmap |
| **Replaced By** | `/Users/aircannon/Claude/Jarvis/projects/Project_Aion.md` |
| **Archived By** | Jarvis v1.0.0 (PR-1.H) |

**Context**: `PROJECT-PLAN.md` was the original project plan document for vanilla AIfred. With the establishment of Project Aion and Jarvis as a divergent Archon, this document is no longer the primary source of truth. It is retained as historical initialization context only.
