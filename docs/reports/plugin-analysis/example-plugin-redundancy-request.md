## Path: /Users/aircannon/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/claude-plugins-official/plugins/example-plugin

## Instructions for code-analyzer agent:

1. **Reverse-engineer plugin functions:**
   - Read all scripts and hooks in the plugin
   - Document the purpose and functionality of each
   - Identify key operations performed

2. **Compare against Jarvis codebase:**
   - Search .claude/scripts/ for similar functionality
   - Search .claude/hooks/ for similar patterns
   - Search .claude/skills/ for overlapping capabilities

3. **Generate overlap report:**
   - List each plugin function
   - Note any Jarvis equivalent
   - Rate overlap: FULL (same function), PARTIAL (similar), NONE (unique)
