# 2. Chronicle entry written (if scope matches)
# 3. session-state.md reflects completion
# 4. AC-03 review passed OR explicitly skipped by user

# VERIFICATION PROTOCOL
# =============================================================================
# How Jarvis verifies documents are actually updated (not just touched)

verification:
  # Check file was modified today
  check_modified_today: "find {} -mtime 0 | grep -q ."

  # Check for unchecked items in scope
  check_pending_items: "grep -c '\\- \\[ \\]' {} || echo 0"

  # Check chronicle has entry for milestone N
  check_chronicle_entry: "grep -q 'Milestone {N}.*COMPLETE\\|Status.*Complete' {}"
