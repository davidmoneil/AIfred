## Summary

Overnight autonomous session executing MCP decomposition, Lean Core v5.9.0 restructuring, Master Wiggum Loop (5 iterations), x-ops consolidation, tool reconstruction backlog progress, marketplace research, and Phase 6 autonomic component operationalization. The most productive session to date — 12 phases completed across 8 context windows.

## Accomplishments

### Phase 1 — MCP Decomposition
- Reduced MCPs from 18 to 5 (memory, local-rag, fetch, git, playwright)
- Created 4 replacement skills: filesystem-ops, git-ops, web-fetch, weather
- 14/14 functional tests passed, registry v2.0
- Saved 9,750 tokens from tool definitions

### Phase 2 — Lean Core v5.9.0
- JICM watcher v5.8.2 fixes
- Manifest router: capability-map.yaml (single authoritative tool selection guide)
- Pipeline design v4.0 (Decomposition-First paradigm)
- Marketplace research: 45 marketplaces, 400+ skills inventoried

### Phases 3-7 — Master Wiggum Loop (5 iterations, 28 tasks)
- Registry v5.0 rewrite with x-ops architecture
- research-ops v2.0: 14 backends (added Tavily, Serper, SerpAPI, Firecrawl, ScraperAPI, Perplexity)
- context-management v4.0: JICM v5.8.2 aligned
- knowledge-ops v2.0: 4-tier memory hierarchy
- Self-knowledge files (strengths, weaknesses, patterns-observed)
- Pattern audit: 39 → 50 patterns, 6 orphaned cross-referenced
- Agent refactoring: 12 agents, unified frontmatter
- CLAUDE.md alignment: all stale references fixed
- capability-map.yaml verification: 21/22 skills, 12/12 agents consistent

### Phase 8 — x-ops Consolidation
- 4 Swiss-Army-Knife router skills: doc-ops, self-ops, mcp-ops, autonom-ops
- capability-map.yaml: 21 → 10 discoverable skills (15 absorbed as subordinates)
- 26 total skill directories

### Phase 9 — Tool Reconstruction & Marketplace Research
- P1 backend validation: 6/8 done (arXiv URL fixed, Perplexity key confirmed)
- 3/5 marketplace research completed (context-engineering, night-market, ai-research-skills)
- Pattern extraction: observation-masking + TDD enforcement (48 → 50 patterns)
- Hook matcher optimization: ~70% fewer hook processes per tool call

### Phase 10 — Phase 6 Readiness + Final Research
- All 9 AC specs reviewed, state files audited
- P3 marketplace research: 5/5 COMPLETE (OMC patterns, Supabase agent skills)
- Finding: Phase 6 far more complete than tracking suggested

### Phase 11 — AC Operationalization Sweep
- AC-01/AC-04: State files synced to "active" (were stale)
- AC-09: Operationalized (telemetry wired, triggers tested) — PR-12.9 COMPLETE
- AC-05: Operationalized (telemetry wired) — PR-12.5 COMPLETE
- AC-06/07/08: Telemetry emission wired (metrics_emission gap CLOSED for all 9 ACs)
- PR-12.10: Confirmed COMPLETE (2 prior runs, 4/4 phases)

### Phase 12 — Session Completion
- AC-01 state file restored (session-start hook had overwritten structured format)
- Session report written
- Final state committed and pushed

## Key Decisions

1. **Decomposition-First paradigm**: Default DECOMPOSE MCPs, only RETAIN server-dependent
2. **4-tier memory hierarchy**: dynamic KG / static KG / semantic RAG / documentary
3. **x-ops consolidation**: 22→12 skills (Swiss-Army-Knife router pattern)
4. **Perplexity key**: `.llm.perplexity` (not `.search`), 4 sonar models
5. **Auto-provisioned MCPs**: Cannot unload; shadow via skills
6. **Self-constitution**: Conditionally approved, directory restructuring deferred
7. **Hook matchers**: Anchored regex → ~70% fewer processes
8. **Phase 6 assessment**: Operationalization gap, not build gap
9. **ai-research-skills**: Deferred to Mac Studio phase (needs GPU)
10. **State file drift**: Systemic issue — computed state > maintained state

---

## Issues Identified

1. **AC-01 state file overwrite**: Session-start hook writes flat JSON, destroying structured format. Needs merge-update logic (EVO-2026-02-005).
2. **State file drift**: AC state JSONs don't auto-update. Several were stale vs operational reality. Future: auto-sync hooks or validation command.
3. **Compression retry loop**: JICM watcher retried /intelligent-compress in infinite loop when compression agent hit rate limit. Needs dead-letter/timeout mechanism.
4. **VERSION vs architecture version**: VERSION file = 2.3.0, architecture = v5.9.0. Different versioning systems.
5. **gitignore exceptions**: AC-01 was untracked (created after gitignore rule); AC-02-09 were tracked (committed before rule).

## Remaining Work

### Immediate (next session)
- PR-12.6 (AC-06 Self-Evolution): Downtime detector, rollback capability (~2-3 hrs)
- PR-12.7 (AC-07 R&D Cycles): File usage tracker hook, external research (~2 hrs)
- PR-12.8 (AC-08 Maintenance): Freshness auditor, organization auditor (~2 hrs)

### Medium-term
- PR-13 (Monitoring/Benchmarks): Telemetry aggregation + dashboard (~4-6 hrs)
- P4 x-ops: research-ops router, knowledge-ops router wiring
- P2 high-value MCPs: BrowserStack, Semgrep, MindsDB, N8N, Repomix, Vizro

### Deferred
- AC-02/AC-03 remediation workflow integration
- Hippocrenae documentation
- Auto-restart after rate-limit pattern
- AC-01 hook merge-update fix (EVO-2026-02-005)

## Self-Assessment

**Productivity**: Exceptional. 12 phases across 8 context windows with 3 JICM compression cycles. The Wiggum Loop (AC-02) pattern drove consistent forward progress.

**Quality**: Good. Found and fixed state file drift, pattern count drift, and stale references. The Phase 6 readiness assessment uncovered that 4 components were already active despite "implementing" status labels.

**Areas for improvement**:
- JICM compression should have a timeout/dead-letter for failed agents
- State files need automatic sync mechanism
- Session-start hook needs to use merge semantics, not overwrite
