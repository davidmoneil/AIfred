## Technical Findings (Level 1)

**Reviewer**: code-review agent
**Files Reviewed**: 8

### Scores

| Dimension | Score |
|-----------|-------|
| Code Quality | 8/10 |
| Test Coverage | 5/10 |
| Documentation | 9/10 |

### Critical Issues

None.

### Errors

None.

### Warnings

| # | File | Line | Finding | Status |
|---|------|------|---------|--------|
| W1 | jarvis-watcher.sh | 1285 | `check_idle_hands()` returns 1 in early exit path. Currently safe (guarded by file-existence check at L1400), but fragile if called without guard. | Non-blocking |
| W2 | jarvis-watcher.sh | 588 | `check_standdown()` returns 1. Safe — called inside `if` conditional. | Non-blocking |
| W3 | jarvis-watcher.sh | 475 | `check_data_consistency()` returns 1. Safe — called inside negation conditional. | Non-blocking |
| W4 | jarvis-watcher.sh | 839 | `detect_idle_state()` / `detect_submission_success()` return 1. Safe — always in conditionals. | Non-blocking |
| W5 | jarvis-watcher.sh | 561 | Temp file `/tmp/jicm-token-method.$$` never cleaned up on exit. | Non-blocking |

### Notes

- All 4 critical fixes (CRIT-01, CRIT-03, CRIT-04, HIGH-05) verified as correctly applied
- AC-04-jicm.md is comprehensive — all 9 spec sections complete for v5.6.2
- No secrets committed in deliverable files
- Version string correctly reads 5.6.2
- 1688-line bash file is large but well-organized with section headers

### Checklist

- [x] All expected files exist (8/8)
- [x] No syntax errors
- [x] No secrets committed
- [x] Error handling present
- [x] Documentation updated
- [ ] Automated tests (N/A — bash infrastructure, manually validated)

## Progress Findings (Level 2)

**Reviewer**: project-manager agent

### Deliverables

| Expected | Complete | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| Predictive loading | Complete (deviated) | Became threshold-based monitoring — exceeded intent |
| Intelligent offloading | Complete (deviated) | Became compression agent architecture — exceeded intent |
| Automated compression | Complete | Full implementation with dual-mechanism resume |
| Enhanced /context-budget | Complete | Real-time tmux monitoring + context-management skill |

**Completion**: 4/4 (100%)
**Scope Assessment**: Implementation evolved from "JICM v2" to v5.6.2 event-driven state machine. Deviation driven by operational necessity, not scope creep.

### Documentation

| Document | Status |
|----------|--------|
| CHANGELOG | Not updated |
| VERSION | Not bumped (still 2.2.2) |
| AC-04-jicm.md | Fully rewritten for v5.6.2 |
| Analysis reports | 3 reports created |
| Future work doc | Created |

### Process Compliance

| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Commits follow conventions | 11/12 compliant (92%) |
| PR description | N/A (branch work) |
| Issues linked | N/A |

### Roadmap Status

PR-12.4 deliverables functionally complete. Roadmap entry should be updated to reflect actual v5.6.2 architecture.

---

## Action Items

### Required Before Full Approval

1. Update CHANGELOG.md with JICM v3→v5.6.2 evolution summary
2. Bump VERSION (suggest 2.3.0 per roadmap versioning policy)

### Recommended

1. Add `rm -f /tmp/jicm-token-method.$$` to `cleanup_with_signal()` (W5)
2. Consider defensive `return 0` at jarvis-watcher.sh:1285 (W1)
3. Update roadmap.md PR-12.4 section to reflect actual deliverables

---

## Remediation

CHANGELOG and VERSION updates are minor remediation items. They do not block continuation of roadmap work but should be addressed in the next commit.

---

## Next Steps

1. PR-12.3: Independent Milestone Review (current — this review validates it)
2. Update CHANGELOG.md and VERSION
3. PR-13: Monitoring, Benchmarking, and Scoring
