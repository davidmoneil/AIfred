## Corrections Analysis

### User Corrections (from corrections.md)

| Category | Count | Severity |
|----------|-------|----------|
| Architecture Decisions | 1 | Medium |
| Workflow Preferences | 2 | Low |
| Technical Constraints | 3 | High |
| Communication Style | 0 | — |

**High-Severity Issues:**
1. **JS hooks require stdin/stdout JSON** — This caused JICM system to be non-functional. Critical infrastructure was broken without visible symptoms.
2. **AIfred baseline is read-only** — Workspace boundaries must be enforced at multiple levels.
3. **PreCompact is notification-only** — Cannot prevent autocompact; proactive management required.

### Self-Corrections (from self-corrections.md)

| Date | Issue | Root Cause |
|------|-------|------------|
| 2026-01-17 | Empty array iteration bug | Missing array length check before bash loop |

**Pattern**: Bash scripting edge cases continue to surface. Consider adding bash linting or stricter defensive coding patterns.

---

## Patterns Observed

### 1. Infrastructure Visibility Gap

**Pattern**: Critical infrastructure (hooks, MCPs) can fail silently without observable symptoms.

**Evidence**:
- JS hooks used wrong format for months without detection
- JICM context tracking was completely non-functional

**Recommendation**: Add health checks that verify hook execution, not just registration.

### 2. Workspace Boundary Enforcement

**Pattern**: Read-only constraints require multi-layer enforcement.

**Evidence**:
- AIfred baseline write protection needed in settings.json deny patterns
- workspace-guard.js hook added as additional layer

**Status**: Addressed with current guardrail hooks.

### 3. Bash Script Robustness

**Pattern**: Dynamically-populated arrays need defensive checks.

**Evidence**:
- Empty array caused unbound variable error in plugin-decompose.sh

**Recommendation**: Add bash linting step or template with defensive patterns.

## Evolution Queue Status

### Existing Proposals (4 pending)

| ID | Title | Risk | Status |
|----|-------|------|--------|
| evo-2026-01-017 | Weather integration in startup | Low | Pending |
| evo-2026-01-018 | AIfred baseline sync check | Low | Pending |
| evo-2026-01-019 | Environment validation in startup | Low | Pending |
| evo-2026-01-020 | Create startup-greeting.js helper | Medium | Pending |

All proposals focus on startup (Phase A/B) enhancements. Good thematic grouping.

### New Proposal Generated

**evo-2026-01-021**: Integrate Claude Code v2.1.10+ Features

Based on R&D research from this session identifying 7 new Claude Code features for potential integration:
- Setup hook event (--init/--maintenance flags)
- auto:N MCP tool search threshold
- plansDirectory setting
- PreToolUse additionalContext injection
- /rename and /resume session commands
- ${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID} skill substitution

## Session-Specific Observations

This was a **context restoration session** following compaction. Key observations:

1. **Context Checkpoint Worked**: Session state restored correctly via AC-01 protocol
2. **Memory MCP Preserved**: All entities survived context transition
3. **Evolution Queue Intact**: 4 proposals persisted across session boundary

No new corrections or issues identified in this short fragment.

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate (This Session)
- None — session exit in progress

### Short-Term (Next Session)
1. Review and prioritize 5 pending evolution proposals
2. Consider grouping evo-017 through evo-020 for startup enhancement sprint

### Long-Term
1. Add hook execution verification to /tooling-health
2. Consider bash linting integration for shell scripts
3. Implement Claude Code feature integration (evo-2026-01-021)
