## Session Analysis

### What Happened

This session was a **context restoration continuation** after JICM triggered auto-compaction during PRD-V4 execution. The session:

1. Successfully restored from checkpoint
2. Continued PRD-V4 Phase 2 TDD Setup
3. Created 53+ test files (unit, integration, E2E)
4. Was terminated by user (`/end-session`) before test execution

### Context Management Assessment

**JICM Performance**: ✅ Working as designed
- Auto-compaction triggered appropriately
- Checkpoint preserved work state
- Session restored cleanly
- No work lost

### Corrections Review

**User Corrections (Historical)**:
| Category | Count | Most Recent |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| Architecture | 1 | Memory systems not redundant (2026-01-09) |
| Workflow | 2 | DEFER not REJECT (2026-01-09) |
| Technical | 5 | Multi-repo credentials (2026-01-20) |
| Communication | 0 | — |

**Self-Corrections (Historical)**:
| Date | Issue | Resolution |
|------|-------|------------|
| 2026-01-18 | wttr.in API headers | Added curl User-Agent |
| 2026-01-17 | Bash empty array iteration | Added length check |

**This Session**: No corrections needed — context restoration and test file creation proceeded without issues.

## Patterns Observed

### Positive Patterns

1. **JICM Reliability**: Context management successfully handled session continuation
2. **TDD Discipline**: Test files created before implementation (proper TDD flow)
3. **PRD Structure**: Stress test protocol generating useful validation data

### Areas for Monitoring

1. **PRD-V4/V5/V6 Completion**: These were marked "VALIDATED" previously but lacked actual deliverables. Retooling in progress.
2. **Session State Drift**: `session-state.md` showed PRD-V2 as current, but actual work was PRD-V4. Consider automated state updates.

---

## Evolution Proposals

### EVO-2026-01-020: Session State Auto-Update

**Problem**: Session state can drift from actual work when context compaction occurs mid-task.

**Proposal**: Add hook or checkpoint logic to auto-update `session-state.md` current work section when:
- TodoWrite changes in_progress task
- Context compaction triggers
- Checkpoint is created

**Priority**: Low (cosmetic, not functional)

**Implementation**: Hook on TodoWrite status changes + checkpoint creation.

## Tool Selection Audit

Only 1 selection audit entry found (from 2026-01-09). This session used appropriate tools:
- Write for test file creation
- Read for configuration review
- No suboptimal selections noted

---

## Recommendations

1. **Continue PRD-V4**: Resume Phase 2 completion, then Phase 3-7
2. **Update Session State**: Sync current work to reflect PRD-V4 progress
3. **Consider State Hook**: Low-priority EVO for automated session state updates

---

## Next Steps

- Complete PRD-V4 Phase 2-7
- Execute PRD-V5 and PRD-V6
- Review this reflection during next `/self-improve` cycle
