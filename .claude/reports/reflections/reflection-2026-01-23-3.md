# Reflection Report — 2026-01-23 (Session 3)

## Summary
- Corrections analyzed: 0 (no corrections.md)
- Problems identified: 1 (systemic)
- Proposals generated: 1 (implemented)

## Session Focus

This session addressed a **systemic documentation hygiene problem** identified by the user:
- Planning/progress documents (roadmap.md, chronicle.md) were not being updated after milestone completion
- The problem stemmed from advisory (not enforced) documentation patterns

## Problem Identified

### Documentation Drift (RESOLVED)

**Severity**: Medium
**Category**: Process/Workflow

**Symptoms**:
- Chronicle showed M2 as "Not started" when M2 was completed
- Roadmap session checkboxes weren't being marked
- Planning documents fell out of sync with actual work

**Root Cause Analysis**:
1. `milestone-review-pattern.md` Section 8 (Completion Documentation) was **advisory, not mandatory**
2. `/end-session` had soft reminders, not hard gates
3. `planning-tracker.yaml` existed but had no enforcement mechanism
4. AC-03 Milestone Review wasn't being triggered consistently
5. No hook to detect milestone completion and prompt for docs

**The Gap**: Documentation patterns described WHAT to do, but nothing ENFORCED doing it.

## Solution Implemented

Created **Milestone Documentation Enforcement System**:

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `planning-tracker.yaml` v2.0 | Added `enforcement: mandatory` field |
| `milestone-completion-gate.yaml` | Defines blocking pre-completion requirements |
| `milestone-doc-enforcer.js` | Hook that detects milestone signals, injects requirements |
| `end-session.md` v2.2 | Added mandatory gate check (Step 0, Step 2) |
| `milestone-review-pattern.md` v1.3 | Section 8 now MANDATORY with gate reference |

## Patterns Observed

### Pattern: Advisory vs. Enforced

**Lesson**: Documentation that says "should" will be forgotten under context pressure. Documentation that says "MUST" with enforcement mechanisms will be followed.

**Application**:
- Enforcement levels: mandatory (blocking) > required (warning) > advisory (reminder)
- Hooks can inject `additionalContext` to surface requirements at decision points
- Gates should be in the workflow, not just in reference docs

### Pattern: Neuro Pathway Gaps

**Lesson**: The "navigation substrate" (Neuro) between work completion and documentation update was missing explicit connections.

**Visualization**:
```
BEFORE: Work Complete ----?----> Document Update (weak/missing link)
AFTER:  Work Complete --HOOK--> Gate Check --MANDATORY--> Document Update
```

## Evolution Proposals

| Proposal | Status | Priority |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Milestone Documentation Enforcement | ✅ IMPLEMENTED | High |

No additional proposals needed — the systemic fix addresses the root cause.

## Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Files created | 2 |
| Files updated | 5 |
| Hooks registered | 1 |
| Patterns updated | 1 |
| Tests performed | 3 (hook execution tests) |

## Next Steps

1. **Test enforcement system** — User will start new session to verify
2. **Update M2 documentation** — Chronicle and roadmap still need updating (deferred per user request)
3. **Monitor effectiveness** — Track if documentation drift recurs
