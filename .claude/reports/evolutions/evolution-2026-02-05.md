## New Proposal Added

### EVO-2026-02-001: Watcher Health Check at Session Start

**Source**: AC-05 Reflection (PRB-003 analysis)
**Priority**: Low
**Risk**: Low (logging only, no process management)

**Problem**:
Duplicate watcher bug was only discovered when user noticed two watchers running. No visibility into watcher state at session start.

**Proposal**:
Add watcher health verification to session-start hook:
1. Check if watcher is running (pgrep)
2. Verify single instance (count processes)
3. Log warning if multiple or none
4. Do NOT launch (leave that to tmux launcher — PAT-006)

**Implementation Path**:
- Add `watcher_health_check()` function to session-start.sh
- Log results to session-start-diagnostic.log
- Warning/info only — no action to avoid race conditions

**Related**:
- PAT-006: Single authority for process launch
- PRB-003: Duplicate watcher race condition (fixed)

---

## Deferred Implementation

### EVO-2026-01-020: Session State Auto-Update

**Status**: Remains queued
**Reason**: Requires hook modifications — better suited for fresh session with full testing

**Next Steps**:
1. Review hook integration points
2. Design minimal change approach
3. Implement with validation in dedicated session

---

## Validation

No implementations this session — validation not required.

---

## Version

No version bump — queue maintenance only.

---

## Rollback Instructions

N/A — no changes to rollback.

---

## Next Session Recommendations

1. **Consider implementing EVO-2026-02-001** (watcher health check) — low risk, high visibility value
2. **Review EVO-2026-01-020** implementation approach — may require dedicated focus session
3. **Monitor watcher stability** — duplicate fix should prevent recurrence
