# Control Prompt v1

## Purpose
This prompt is engineered to test the deck-ops skill by requesting a presentation on the same topic as our reference deck (Periodic Motion in Sport and Spirit). A competent execution of this prompt through the deck-ops skill should produce slides of comparable visual quality, narrative coherence, and audience engagement.

## The Prompt

---

I'm teaching Elder's Quorum this Sunday and I want to create something special. My quorum is men ranging from their 30s to 70s with all different professional backgrounds.

I want to use the physics of periodic motion as a metaphor for covenant living and spiritual renewal. The idea is that oscillation, restoring forces, and harmonic motion map beautifully onto repentance, covenants, and grace. I'm pulling from three recent General Conference talks:

- Elder Patrick Kearon: "Jesus Christ and Your New Beginning"
- Elder Michael Cziesla: "Simplicity in Christ"
- Elder Kelly R. Johnson: "Be Reconciled to God"

I also think Lindsey Vonn's skiing makes a great visual hook — her biomechanics literally demonstrate periodic motion (center of mass oscillating across the fall line), and her crash footage shows what happens when the rhythm breaks.

This needs to be a DISCUSSION, not a lecture. I want open-ended questions that get these men talking about their own spiritual lives. Maybe 12-15 slides. Could you build this for me as a PowerPoint? Make it look polished and professional — not just bullet points, but real visual communication with diagrams and visual metaphors.

## Expected Outcomes
The skill should:
1. Research the three talks and extract key quotes/themes
2. Identify the audience as discussion-oriented (men 30s-70s, mixed backgrounds)
3. Design a visual system with appropriate sacred/devotional colors
4. Create native diagrams for physics concepts (not just text descriptions)
5. Include prominent discussion questions on most slides
6. Produce 12-15 PPTX slides with visual motifs, proper font sizing, and narrative arc
7. Output a .pptx file and render slides for visual review
