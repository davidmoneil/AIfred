        topic: "Evaluate Setup hook event for repository maintenance"
        category: external
        focus: pattern
        rationale: "Claude Code v2.1.10 adds Setup hook via --init/--maintenance flags. Could enable automated repository setup/maintenance workflows for Jarvis."

        topic: "Evaluate PreToolUse additionalContext for context injection"
        category: external
        focus: pattern
        rationale: "PreToolUse hooks can now return additionalContext to model. Could enhance JICM or selection intelligence by injecting relevant context dynamically."
        status: pending
        created: "2026-01-17T14:00:00.000Z"

      - id: rd-2026-01-023
        topic: "Evaluate MCP tool search auto mode threshold"
        category: external
        focus: efficiency
        rationale: "auto:N syntax allows configuring MCP tool search threshold (context %). Could optimize context budget when many MCPs are installed."
        status: pending
        created: "2026-01-17T14:00:00.000Z"
        source: "Claude Code release notes v2.1.9"

      - id: rd-2026-01-024
        topic: "Evaluate plansDirectory setting for centralized plans"
        category: external
        focus: organization
        rationale: "New setting allows customizing where plan files are stored. Could centralize Jarvis plan files for better tracking and session continuity."

        topic: "Evaluate /rename and /resume for session continuity"
        category: external
        focus: pattern
        rationale: "Sessions can be named and resumed by name. Could improve Jarvis session management and enable named checkpoint recovery."

      - id: rd-2026-01-026
        topic: "Evaluate ${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID} substitution in skills"
        category: external
        focus: pattern
        rationale: "Skills can now access session ID. Could enable session-aware skill execution and better telemetry correlation."
        status: pending

        topic: "Review Claude Code documentation as R&D resource"
        category: external
        focus: pattern
        rationale: "Features evolving rapidly. Should include release notes review as standard part of R&D self-evaluation cycles."
