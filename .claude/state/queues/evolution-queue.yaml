      title: "Integrate Claude Code v2.1.10+ features"
      description: >
        R&D research identified 7 new Claude Code features for potential
        Jarvis integration: (1) Setup hook event via --init/--maintenance
        flags for automated repository setup, (2) auto:N MCP tool search
        threshold for context budget optimization, (3) plansDirectory setting
        for centralized plan tracking, (4) PreToolUse additionalContext
        injection for hook-based context enrichment, (5) /rename and /resume
        for session naming/resumption, (6) ${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID} substitution
        for session-aware skills, (7) MCP tool search auto mode.

        - .claude/settings.json
        - .claude/hooks/session-start.sh
        - .claude/context/patterns/context-budget-management.md
      rationale: >
        Claude Code is evolving rapidly. Jarvis should track and adopt
        beneficial features to improve autonomy and context management.
        Features were documented in Memory MCP entity "Jarvis Self-Evolution".

      implementation_notes: >
        Most features implemented via individual proposals. Remaining:
        ${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID} in telemetry (evo-2026-01-027).

      title: "Add ${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID} to telemetry skills"
      description: >
        Skills can now access ${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID} for session-aware
        execution. Jarvis telemetry and logging should use this for
        correlation across session events.

        R&D cycle identified as ADOPT item. Enables better session
        tracking and telemetry correlation.
