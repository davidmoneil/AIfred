    title: "Long Idle Detection Patterns"
    description: |
      Research patterns for detecting extended idle periods (>30 min) and
      appropriate autonomous actions to take during downtime.
    priority: MEDIUM
    source: JICM v5 idle-hands architecture
    created: 2026-02-04

      - .claude/scripts/jarvis-watcher.sh
      - .claude/context/designs/jicm-v5-design-addendum.md
    notes: |
      Consider: self-improvement cycles, documentation review, health checks

    title: "Workflow Chain Automation"
    description: |
      Research patterns for chaining workflows across sessions when one task
      triggers another (e.g., test failure → fix → retest).
    priority: LOW
    source: idle-hands mode extension idea
    created: 2026-02-04
    related_files:

    notes: |
      May require persistent state tracking across /clear cycles

    title: "Context Compression Optimization"
    description: |
      Research optimal compression strategies for different work types
      (coding vs research vs documentation).
    priority: MEDIUM
    source: JICM v5 compression agent observations
    created: 2026-02-04

    notes: |
      Current 12:1 ratio is good but may be improvable for specific patterns

    title: "tmux Self-Injection Limitation"
    description: "Investigated why Bash tool calls cannot inject prompts to same session"
    priority: HIGH
    source: JICM v5 development
    completed: 2026-02-04
    result: DOCUMENTED
    outcome_file: .claude/context/lessons/tmux-self-injection-limitation.md
    notes: |
      Root cause: Ink TUI raw mode creates input state collision.
      Solution: Use external watcher process for all prompt injection.
