# Workflows

**Purpose**: Repeatable procedures for completing large tasks within sessions.

**Layer**: Nous (procedural knowledge)

## What Belongs Here

- Step-by-step procedures
- Task completion workflows
- Session-level procedures

## What Does NOT Belong Here

- Behavioral patterns → `patterns/`
- Standards and rules → `standards/`
- Session work plans → `plans/`

## Hierarchy Context

```
Standards (MUST follow)
    ↓
Patterns (SHOULD follow)

## Current Contents

| Workflow | Purpose | When to Use |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `session-exit.md` | Clean session termination | Every session end |
| `archon-maintenance-workflow.md` | Organizational health & integration | Large integrations, quarterly maintenance |
| `wiggum-loop.md` | Iterative exploratory testing (5-step cycles) | Rigorous testing, experimentation, research loops |

## Usage

Workflows are consulted when performing specific large tasks.
They sit between abstract patterns and concrete plans.

### archon-maintenance-workflow.md

Comprehensive 7-phase workflow for:
- Large-scale integration efforts (porting from external sources)
- Routine maintenance to correct Neuro drift
- Layer boundary enforcement
- Documentation refresh

**Schedule**:
- Weekly: 5-minute quick check
- Monthly: 30-minute light maintenance
- Quarterly: 2-4 hour full workflow
- Before major integration: Full workflow with integration phase
