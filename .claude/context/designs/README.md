# Designs

**Purpose**: Operational architecture designs — design philosophy and system architecture that guide Jarvis' behavior.

**Layer**: Nous (architectural knowledge)

## What Belongs Here

- Operational architecture documents
- Design philosophy specifications
- System integration designs
- Architectural decision records

## What Does NOT Belong Here

- Project-specific designs → `projects/project-aion/designs/`
- Behavioral patterns → `patterns/`
- Implementation procedures → `workflows/`

## Hierarchy Context

```
Standards (MUST follow)
    ↓
Patterns (SHOULD follow)
    ↓
Workflows (Large task procedures)
    ↓
Designs (Architecture philosophy) ← YOU ARE HERE
    ↓
Plans (Session-level work)
```

## Current Design Documents

## Key Distinction

**Operational designs** (here): How Jarvis is architecturally structured
**Project designs** (`projects/project-aion/designs/`): Designs for specific development work
