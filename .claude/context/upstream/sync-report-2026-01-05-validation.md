## Detailed Analysis

### REJECT (Skip)

#### `.claude/context/patterns/sync-validation-test.md`

- **Change**: New file added — "Sync Validation Test Pattern"
- **Rationale**: This is a test artifact intentionally created to validate the `/sync-aifred-baseline` workflow. It contains no production functionality and explicitly states it should be rejected.
- **Jarvis Alternative**: N/A — test artifact only

**File Contents Summary**:
- Purpose: Validate Jarvis upstream sync workflow
- Self-declares: "This file should be classified as reject"
- No functional patterns or reusable content

---

## Validation Results

This sync report was generated as part of **PR-3 validation testing**. The workflow successfully:

1. ✅ Detected upstream changes (1 commit since `dc0e8ac`)
2. ✅ Generated file-level diff correctly
3. ✅ Categorized file by type (Patterns)
4. ✅ Applied classification criteria appropriately
5. ✅ Generated structured report

---

## Recommended Actions

1. **Mark validation complete** — The sync workflow is working as designed
2. **Optionally clean up** — Remove test file from AIfred baseline if desired
3. **Update port-log** — Record this validation test in port history
