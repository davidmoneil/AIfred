## How to Use

When Claude makes a mistake and you correct it, Claude should ask:
"Should I save this as a lesson learned?"

If yes, add an entry below with:
- **Date**: When it happened
- **Topic**: What area/feature
- **Mistake**: What Claude did wrong
- **Correction**: What you said
- **Lesson**: The pattern to follow going forward
