# Components

**Purpose**: Autonomic Component specifications — the nine systems that enable Jarvis' autonomy.

**Layer**: Nous (core behavioral definitions)

## The Nine Autonomic Components

| Component | ID | Purpose |
|-----------|-----|---------|
| Self-Launch | AC-01 | Session initialization with full context awareness |
| Wiggum Loop | AC-02 | Multi-pass verification (DEFAULT behavior) |
| Milestone Review | AC-03 | Independent quality gate at milestones |
| JICM | AC-04 | Intelligent context management |
| Self-Reflection | AC-05 | Learn from experience |
| Self-Evolution | AC-06 | Safe self-modification |
| R&D Cycles | AC-07 | External + internal research |
| Maintenance | AC-08 | Cleanup, audits, health checks |
| Session Completion | AC-09 | User-prompted clean exit |

## Specification Standard

Each component follows the template in `templates/autonomic-component-spec.md`:
- Identity, Triggers, Inputs, Outputs
- Dependencies, Consumers, Gates
- Metrics, Failure Modes

## Key Principle

Components define the **ability** to do something.
Records of **doing** it live elsewhere (reports, progress).
