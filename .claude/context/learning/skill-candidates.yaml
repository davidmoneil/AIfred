# Skill Candidates — populated by /reflect Phase 2.5
# Repeated multi-step processes detected during reflection that may warrant skill promotion.
#
# Fields:
#   name: Short identifier for the pattern
#   description: What the repeated process does
#   trigger: When/how the user invokes this pattern
#   frequency: How many times observed (incremented each reflection)
#   complexity: low | medium | high
#   first_seen: Date first detected
#   last_seen: Date last observed
#   source_sessions: List of session dates where pattern was observed
#   status: candidate | promoted | rejected
#   notes: Additional context
#
# Promotion threshold: frequency >= 3 AND complexity <= medium
# High-complexity candidates become evolution proposals instead.
