TOP 5 FOR JICM (Ranked by Value):
==================================

#1. CONTEXT-COMPRESSION ★★★★★
    Most directly applicable to JICM's 65% compression target
    - Anchored Iterative Summarization: structured summaries (intent, modifications, decisions, next steps)
    - Opaque Compression: >99% compression ratio
    - Regenerative Full Summary: readable but lossy
    KEY: Use Anchored approach—merge new summaries into persistent sections

#2. MEMORY-SYSTEMS ★★★★★
    Essential for session continuity
    - Layered: Working → Short-term → Long-term → Entity → Temporal Knowledge Graphs
    - File-system-as-memory pattern (simple, debuggable)
    - Just-in-time loading at attention-favored positions
    KEY: Session-scoped short-term + cross-session long-term storage

#3. CONTEXT-OPTIMIZATION ★★★★★
    Extends effective capacity
    - Observation Masking: 60-80% reduction in tool outputs (they consume 80%+ of context!)
    - Compaction: 50-70% reduction in old turns/documents
    - KV-Cache Optimization: order stable content first for prefix hits
    - Context Partitioning: isolate sub-agent contexts
    KEY: Combine masking + compaction for multiplicative effect

#4. CONTEXT-DEGRADATION ★★★★
    Robustness foundation
    - Lost-in-middle: U-shaped attention, 10-40% lower recall in middle
    - Context poisoning: errors compound through repeated reference
    - Threshold validation: 70-80% utilization is empirically justified
    KEY: Justify compression triggers scientifically; detect poisoning

#5. FILESYSTEM-CONTEXT ★★★★
    Memory storage strategy
    - Static context (system prompts) vs. dynamic context (on-demand)
    - Search tools: ls, glob, grep, read_file with line ranges
    - Tool output offloading: write >2000 tokens to files
    KEY: Store memories in /Jarvis/.claude/context/jicm/sessions/{id}/ with YAML/JSON


KEY TECHNIQUES EXTRACTABLE:
===========================

Compression:
  • Anchored Iterative Summarization (persistent sections)
  • Tokens-per-task metric (not tokens-per-request)
  • Progressive disclosure (load on-demand)

Memory:
  • Layered architecture (working/short-term/long-term)
  • Just-in-time loading (retrieve when needed)
  • File-system-as-memory (simple hierarchy)

Optimization:
  • Observation Masking (compress tool outputs)
  • KV-Cache ordering (stable content first)
  • Context Partitioning (isolate sub-agents)

Session Continuity:
  • Progressive retrieval layers (4-tier model)
  • State archival at session boundaries
  • Degradation thresholds (70-80%)

Robustness:
  • Lost-in-middle avoidance (place critical info at edges)
  • Context poisoning detection (verify before re-injection)
  • Confidence scores + timestamps


IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS FOR JICM:
================================

Phase 1 (Foundation):
  □ Adopt Anchored Iterative Summarization structure
  □ Test at 65% compression trigger
  □ Validate reconstruction quality

Phase 2 (Memory):
  □ Implement file-system-as-memory in /jicm/sessions/{id}/
  □ Add session state archival at session end
  □ Build just-in-time retrieval index

Phase 3 (Optimization):
  □ Implement Observation Masking for tool outputs
  □ Validate 60-80% reduction targets
  □ Combine with Phase 1 compaction

Phase 4 (Robustness):
  □ Add poisoning detection (verify + confidence scores)
  □ Degradation testing suite
  □ Task-specific threshold calibration


CORE INSIGHTS:
==============

1. Context limitations stem from ATTENTION MECHANICS, not token capacity alone
   - U-shaped attention curve exists empirically
   - Middle content receives 10-40% lower attention
   - Lost-in-the-middle is structural, not a bug

2. Tool outputs consume 80%+ of context in agent workflows
   - Observation Masking directly targets this
   - Can achieve 60-80% reduction with file references

3. Compression should optimize for TOKENS-PER-TASK, not tokens-per-request
   - Losing file paths costs more in re-fetching than tokens saved
   - Structured summaries enable reconstruction

4. Session continuity requires layered memory, not just compression
   - Short-term: session-scoped (fast access, volatile)
   - Long-term: persistent (slower access, cross-session)
   - Progressive retrieval (on-demand, not all-in-context)

5. Thresholds are empirically justified
   - 70-80% compression trigger matches attention degradation onset
   - Safe operating window: 50-70% for most workflows
   - Different task types may need different thresholds
