# Soft Restart Checkpoint

**Created**: 2026-01-07
**Type**: smart-checkpoint
**Reason**: PR-8.3.1 validation — testing checkpoint creation and restoration workflow

---

## Context to Restore

### What We Were Doing

Testing the PR-8.3.1 hook validation workflow:
1. Verified SessionStart hook fires correctly on startup
2. Confirmed MCP dynamic loading works (Tier 2/3 MCPs dropped as expected)
3. Tested `/smart-checkpoint` command to validate the full workflow

### Key Test Results

- SessionStart hook: **WORKING** (displayed on-screen)
- MCP configuration: **CORRECT** (Tier 1 only + github kept, Tier 2/3 dropped)
- `/mcp` command confirmed: 7 servers total, time MCP not loaded

### MCP State

**Kept (Tier 1):**
- memory
- filesystem
- fetch
- git

**Dropped:**
- github (~15K tokens saved)

**Already Not Loaded:**
- time, context7, sequential-thinking

### Next Steps

1. **Verify this checkpoint was detected** — session-start hook should display this content
2. **Test /clear soft restart path** — run `/clear`, check if SessionStart fires with source="clear"
3. **If working**: Document PR-8.3.1 as complete, move to PR-8.4

## How to Continue

Say "continue" or "resume from checkpoint" to pick up where we left off.
