# Context Checkpoint

**Created**: 2026-01-17 (evening)
**Reason**: Context optimization after Phase 6 implementation validation

## Work Summary

Completed validation and infrastructure creation for all Phase 6 Autonomic Components (AC-03 through AC-09):

**Components Validated:**
- AC-03 Milestone Review — Created code-review + project-manager agents, review-criteria defaults
- AC-04 JICM — Created state file (infrastructure already existed)
- AC-05 Self-Reflection — Created /reflect command, lessons directory, evolution queue
- AC-06 Self-Evolution — Created /evolve command, reports directory
- AC-07 R&D Cycles — Created /research command, research-agenda.yaml
- AC-08 Maintenance — Created /maintain command, reports directory
- AC-09 Session Completion — Created state file (/end-session already existed)

**New Agents Created:**
- `.claude/agents/code-review.md` — Technical review (AC-03 Level 1)
- `.claude/agents/project-manager.md` — Progress review (AC-03 Level 2)

**New Commands Created:**
- `/reflect` — Self-reflection cycle
- `/evolve` — Self-evolution cycle
- `/research` — R&D cycles
- `/maintain` — Maintenance workflows

## Next Steps After Restart

1. **Runtime Testing**: Test each component's triggers and workflows
2. **PR-13 Telemetry**: Metrics emission system for all components (5/9 validation items pending)
3. **Integration Testing**: Verify component interactions (AC-02→AC-03, AC-05→AC-06, etc.)
4. **Consider Version Bump**: v2.1.0 release after validation complete

## Critical Context

**Validation Status (all components):**
- 4/9 validation items complete per component
- All have: specs, patterns, state files, dependencies
- Pending: triggers, gates, metrics, integration testing

**Phase 6 Design Status:**
- All 9 component specs complete
- All 9 pattern documents exist
- Infrastructure in place for full autonomic system

**Branch**: Project_Aion (working branch)

## MCP State

| MCP | Action | Reason |
|-----|--------|--------|
| memory | KEEP | Tier 1 - essential |
| filesystem | KEEP | Tier 1 - essential |
| fetch | KEEP | Tier 1 - essential |
| git | KEEP | Tier 1 - essential |
| github | DISABLED | Not needed for runtime testing |
| context7 | DISABLED | Research complete |
| sequential-thinking | DISABLED | Planning complete |

**MCPs already optimized** — No additional disabling needed.
