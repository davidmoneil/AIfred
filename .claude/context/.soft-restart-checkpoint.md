# Context Checkpoint

**Created**: 2026-01-07 20:44:54
**Reason**: Proactive context optimization

## Work Summary

Session started fresh after previous checkpoint. No specific task was in progress. MCPs were already optimized from previous checkpoint (github, context7, sequential-thinking disabled).

## Next Steps After Restart

1. Continue with PR-8.4: MCP Validation Harness if desired
2. Or await user direction for next task
3. Run `/context-budget` to verify reduced context

## Critical Context

- PR-8.3.1 complete and validated
- Context checkpoint workflow working end-to-end
- MCP disable/enable scripts functional
- Tier 1 MCPs active: memory, filesystem, fetch, git (~21K tokens)

## MCP State

| MCP | Action | Reason |
|-----|--------|--------|
| memory | KEEP | Tier 1 - essential |
| filesystem | KEEP | Tier 1 - essential |
| fetch | KEEP | Tier 1 - essential |
| git | KEEP | Tier 1 - core workflow |
| github | DISABLED | No PR/issue work planned |
| context7 | DISABLED | No research phase |
| sequential-thinking | DISABLED | No complex planning |
