# Context Checkpoint

**Created**: 2026-01-07
**Reason**: Context optimization (PR-8.3.1 validation)

## Work Summary

- Tested /context-checkpoint command workflow end-to-end
- Verified PR-8.3.1 context management patterns
- Confirmed disabledMcpServers mechanism working
- Read multiple project files to simulate context growth

## Next Steps After Restart

1. Update documentation files
2. Review test results

## Critical Context

- PR-8.3.1 validation in progress
- disabledMcpServers array in ~/.claude.json is the key mechanism
- /clear respects disabled MCPs (validated 2026-01-07)
- Tier 1 MCPs: memory, filesystem, fetch (never disable)

## MCP State

| MCP | Action | Reason |
|-----|--------|--------|
| memory | KEEP | Tier 1 - always on |
| filesystem | KEEP | Tier 1 - always on |
| fetch | KEEP | Tier 1 - always on |
| github | DISABLED | No PR work planned |
| git | DISABLED | Doc updates don't need git MCP |
| context7 | DISABLED | Research phase complete |
| sequential-thinking | DISABLED | Planning phase complete |

## Token Savings

Estimated: ~32K tokens (github ~15K, git ~4K, context7 ~8K, sequential-thinking ~5K)
