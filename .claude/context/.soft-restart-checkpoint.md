# Context Checkpoint

**Created**: 2026-01-07
**Reason**: Context optimization

## Work Summary

This session tested the /context-checkpoint workflow end-to-end. The workflow validated the MCP disable/enable scripts and checkpoint file creation. PR-8.3.1 context management implementation is complete.

## Next Steps After Restart

1. Update documentation files
2. Review test results

## Critical Context

- PR-8.3.1 is complete with working MCP control scripts
- disabledMcpServers array mechanism is validated
- SessionStart hook loads checkpoint on /clear

## MCP State

| MCP | Action | Reason |
|-----|--------|--------|
| memory | KEEP | Tier 1 — Always required |
| filesystem | KEEP | Tier 1 — Always required |
| fetch | KEEP | Tier 1 — Always required |
| github | DISABLED | No PR/issue work in next steps |
| git | DISABLED | No git operations in next steps |
| context7 | DISABLED | No documentation research needed |
| sequential-thinking | DISABLED | No complex planning needed |
| playwright | DISABLED | No browser automation needed |
| gitlab | DISABLED | Not in use |

## Token Savings Estimate

~40K tokens freed from disabling Tier 2/3 MCPs
