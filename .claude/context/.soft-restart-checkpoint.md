# Context Checkpoint

**Created**: 2026-01-07
**Reason**: Context optimization — testing /context-checkpoint workflow

## Work Summary

- Tested MCP status commands (`claude mcp list`)
- Verified disabledMcpServers array is empty
- Ran /context-checkpoint workflow for testing

## Next Steps After Restart

1. Update documentation files
2. Review test results

## Critical Context

- PR-8.3.1 Context Checkpoint workflow validated end-to-end
- disabledMcpServers mechanism confirmed working
- MCPs disabled via scripts, changes take effect on /clear

## MCP State

| MCP | Action | Reason |
|-----|--------|--------|
| memory | KEEP | Tier 1 - Always on |
| filesystem | KEEP | Tier 1 - Always on |
| fetch | KEEP | Tier 1 - Always on |
| github | DISABLED | No PR/issue work planned |
| git | DISABLED | No git operations planned |
| context7 | DISABLED | No research needed |
| sequential-thinking | DISABLED | Implementation phase |

## Token Savings

- Before: ~16K MCP tokens
- After: ~8K MCP tokens (Tier 1 only)
- Estimated savings: ~8K tokens
