# Context Checkpoint

**Created**: 2026-01-07
**Reason**: Context optimization (proactive checkpoint)

## Work Summary

Session initiated with `/context-checkpoint` command for proactive context management. No specific work was in progress - this is a fresh session optimization.

Previous session completed:
- PR-8.3.1 context checkpoint workflow validated end-to-end
- MCP control scripts created (disable-mcps.sh, enable-mcps.sh, list-mcp-status.sh)
- `/context-checkpoint` command created and tested

## Next Steps After Restart

1. Review current priorities in `.claude/context/projects/current-priorities.md`
2. Begin next planned work (PR-8.4: MCP Validation Harness or other priority)
3. Re-enable MCPs as needed based on work type

## Critical Context

- All PR-8.3.1 work complete and committed
- MCP tier system operational
- Scripts validated for MCP enable/disable workflow

## MCP State

| MCP | Action | Reason |
|-----|--------|--------|
| memory | KEEP | Tier 1 - persistent knowledge |
| filesystem | KEEP | Tier 1 - file operations |
| fetch | KEEP | Tier 1 - web content |
| git | KEEP | Tier 1 - core workflow |
| github | DISABLED | No PR/issue work planned |
| context7 | DISABLED | No research/docs planned |
| sequential-thinking | DISABLED | No complex planning planned |

## Re-enabling MCPs

When specific work requires disabled MCPs:
```bash
.claude/scripts/enable-mcps.sh github context7 sequential-thinking
# Then /clear to load them
```
