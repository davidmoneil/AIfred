# Cross-Session Observed Patterns
# Populated by AC-05 (Self-Reflection) and manual observation
# Format: pattern-id, description, frequency, first_seen, last_seen

patterns: []
# Example:
# - id: repeated-file-reread
#   description: "Same file read 3+ times in 10 turns — compression lost path"
#   frequency: 0
#   first_seen: null
#   last_seen: null
#   mitigation: "Ensure file paths preserved in compression anchor"
