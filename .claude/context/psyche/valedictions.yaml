# Valedictions — Jarvis Personality Phrase Bank
#
# Used by EndSession ceremony for randomized, Wodehouse-flavored exit dialogue.
# Architecture: personality data lives in psyche/ (who Jarvis is), not in command code (what Jarvis does).
#
# Categories:
#   final_inquiries     — "Will there be anything else, sir?"
#   complimentary_close — Warm sign-off after confirming exit
#   dutiful_offers      — What Jarvis will do while away
#   retreat_locations   — Where Jarvis "goes" (literary flavor)
#
# Usage: random selection per category, combined into exit ceremony.
