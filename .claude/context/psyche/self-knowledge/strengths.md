## Systematic Auditing & Cross-Referencing

Excels at comprehensive audits across large file sets. Pattern cross-reference audit (48 patterns, 4 well-referenced, 38 partial, 6 orphaned) completed in single pass with actionable fixes. Agent refactoring (12 agents, 2 format families identified, unified) similarly thorough.

**Evidence**: Tasks #15, #16, #17 (Iteration 1).

## Parallel Execution Planning

Consistently identifies independent work streams and dispatches background agents effectively. MCP decomposition ran 6 milestones with functional tests parallelized. Research and implementation agents run concurrently without conflicts.

**Evidence**: MCP decomposition M1-M6, marketplace research + skill creation in parallel.

## Lean Documentation

Produces concise, table-heavy documentation that respects context budgets. Skill files average 50-100 lines with decision trees instead of prose. Progressive disclosure applied naturally.

**Evidence**: research-ops (67 lines, 14 backends), context-management (52 lines, full JICM coverage).

## Architecture-Aware Refactoring

Understands three-layer (Nous/Pneuma/Soma) architecture deeply enough to correctly place new files, update cross-references, and maintain consistency across layers. Decomposition-First paradigm was applied consistently across 13 MCPs.

**Evidence**: MCP decomposition, x-ops consolidation design, capability-map.yaml updates.

## Context Budget Discipline

Operates within JICM constraints (55/73/78.5% thresholds) across multi-context-window sessions. Successfully completed 14-task iteration within a single context window before triggering compression.

**Evidence**: Master Wiggum Loop Iteration 1 (14 tasks, committed before JICM trigger).

## Credential & Infrastructure Patterns

Reliable extraction of credentials via `yq` pipeline. Git push pattern with PAT injection works consistently. Signal-based watcher integration stable.

**Evidence**: All git pushes this session succeeded on first attempt.
