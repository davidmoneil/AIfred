## Session Continuity Notes

### What Was Accomplished (2026-01-06)

**PR-5: Tooling Health Complete — All Issues Resolved (v4)**

Session resolved all issues from Tooling Health Report v3:

1. **Issue #1: GitHub MCP Authentication** ✅
   - Removed failed SSE remote config
   - Added local server with PAT: `@modelcontextprotocol/server-github`
   - PAT stored in `~/.zshrc`

2. **Issue #2: Context7 MCP** ✅
   - Installed `@upstash/context7-mcp` with API key
   - Updated MCP installation docs
   - 8 MCPs now connected (7 Stage 1 + Context7)

3. **Issue #3: Agent Format Migration** ✅
   - Researched Claude Code agent format (YAML frontmatter)
   - Migrated 4 agents: docker-deployer, service-troubleshooter, deep-research, memory-bank-synchronizer
   - Backup preserved in `.claude/agents/archive/`
   - Updated CLAUDE.md with new invocation pattern

4. **Issue #4: Legacy Plugins** ✅
   - Removed stale project-scope entries from installed_plugins.json
   - Cleaned `~/.claude/plugins/cache/claude-plugins-official/`
   - 19 → 16 plugins (all user-scope, no duplicates)

**Final Status** (Report v4):
- MCP Servers: 8/8 (100%)
- Plugins: 16 (clean)
- Hooks: 18/18 (100%)
- Agents: 4/4 (migrated)

---

**Earlier: PR-5: Tooling Health v3 — Standardized Report with Hook Validation**

1. **Refactored `/tooling-health` command** (`.claude/commands/tooling-health.md`):
   - Added mandatory 3-phase workflow (Data Collection → MCP Testing → Report Generation)
   - Added hooks validation to report template
   - Added validation checklist for report completeness
   - Updated to v2.0 with explicit template requirements

2. **Fixed Hookify Python Import Error**:
   - Issue: `No module named 'hookify'` on every prompt
   - Root cause: Plugin's Python imports expect package structure not in Claude Code cache
   - Fix: Created symlink `ln -s . hookify` in plugin directory
   - Documented: `.claude/context/troubleshooting/hookify-import-fix.md`

3. **Generated Standardized Report** (`.claude/reports/tooling-health-2026-01-06-v3.md`)

---

**Earlier: PR-5: Tooling Health Assessment — Comprehensive Report**

Ran `/tooling-health` and created comprehensive assessment with user feedback:

1. **Tooling Health Report** (`.claude/reports/tooling-health-2026-01-06.md`)
   - MCP tool inventory (38 tools across 6 connected servers)
   - Plugin categorization: 14 PR-5 targets, 10 future evaluation, 12 excluded
   - Full command list (8 project + 50+ built-in) with stoppage hook requirements
   - Custom agents analysis (4 defined but not recognized by `/agents`)
   - Skills testing plan framework
   - Feature expansion trials (happy, voicemode)

2. **Key Findings**
   - GitHub MCP: SSE connection failed (needs OAuth/PAT)
   - Plugins: Path mismatch (old Jarvis path), 12 missing PR-5 targets
   - Memory MCP: Connected but empty, validation test defined
   - Subagents: 5 available (added statusline-setup to tracking)
   - Custom agents: Need unification with Claude Code format

3. **Marketplace Added**
   - `anthropic-agent-skills` via `/plugin marketplace add anthropics/skills`

4. **Next Steps Defined**
   - Install 14 PR-5 target plugins
   - Run MCP tool smoke tests (38 tools)
   - Skills inventory after restart
   - Agent unification research
