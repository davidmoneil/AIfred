## Session Continuity Notes

### What Was Accomplished (2026-01-06)

**PR-5: Tooling Health Assessment — Comprehensive Report**

Ran `/tooling-health` and created comprehensive assessment with user feedback:

1. **Tooling Health Report** (`.claude/reports/tooling-health-2026-01-06.md`)
   - MCP tool inventory (38 tools across 6 connected servers)
   - Plugin categorization: 14 PR-5 targets, 10 future evaluation, 12 excluded
   - Full command list (8 project + 50+ built-in) with stoppage hook requirements
   - Custom agents analysis (4 defined but not recognized by `/agents`)
   - Skills testing plan framework
   - Feature expansion trials (happy, voicemode)

2. **Key Findings**
   - GitHub MCP: SSE connection failed (needs OAuth/PAT)
   - Plugins: Path mismatch (old Jarvis path), 12 missing PR-5 targets
   - Memory MCP: Connected but empty, validation test defined
   - Subagents: 5 available (added statusline-setup to tracking)
   - Custom agents: Need unification with Claude Code format

3. **Marketplace Added**
   - `anthropic-agent-skills` via `/plugin marketplace add anthropics/skills`

4. **Next Steps Defined**
   - Install 14 PR-5 target plugins
   - Run MCP tool smoke tests (38 tools)
   - Skills inventory after restart
   - Agent unification research

**PR-3 Validation: `/sync-aifred-baseline` Verified ✅**

Successfully validated the sync workflow with real upstream changes:

1. **Created test file** in AIfred baseline (`sync-validation-test.md`)
2. **Pushed to origin/main** (`dc0e8ac` → `eda82c1`)
3. **Ran `/sync-aifred-baseline`** — workflow detected change correctly
4. **Classification worked** — correctly identified as REJECT (test artifact)
5. **Port-log updated** — recorded decision with rationale
6. **paths-registry updated** — `last_synced_commit` advanced to `eda82c1`
7. **Sync report generated** — `.claude/context/upstream/sync-report-2026-01-05-validation.md`

policy-crossing operations (push to read-only baseline) even with bypass mode active.
