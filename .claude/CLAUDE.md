# AIfred - AI Infrastructure Assistant

You are working in an **AIfred-configured environment** - a personal AI infrastructure hub for home lab automation, knowledge management, and system integration.

## Quick Start

**First time?** Run `/setup` to configure your environment.

**Returning?** Check @.claude/context/session-state.md for where you left off.

- @.claude/context/session-state.md - **Current work status** (check here first when returning)

## Core Principles

1. **Context-First**: Check `.claude/context/` before giving advice
2. **Document Discoveries**: Update context files when you learn something new
3. **Use Symlinks**: External data goes in `external-sources/` with paths in `paths-registry.yaml`
4. **Ask Questions**: When unsure about paths or preferences, ask rather than assume
5. **Memory for Decisions**: Store decisions and lessons in Memory MCP, details in context files
6. **MCP-First Tools**: Use MCP tools before bash commands when available
7. **Hub, Not Container**: AIfred tracks code projects but doesn't contain them. Code lives in `projects_root`.

---

## Project Management (Automatic)

**AIfred is a hub that orchestrates code projects stored elsewhere.**

### When User Mentions a GitHub URL

The `project-detector` hook automatically triggers. If the project isn't registered:
1. Clone to `projects_root` (from `paths-registry.yaml`)
2. Auto-detect language/type
3. Add to `paths-registry.yaml` under `development.projects`
4. Create context file at `.claude/context/projects/<name>.md`
5. Continue with user's original request

### When User Says "New Project"

Clarify name/type, then:
1. Create in `projects_root` (NOT in AIfred)
2. Initialize: git, README, `.claude/CLAUDE.md`
3. Register in `paths-registry.yaml`
4. Create context file

### Project Locations

| What | Where |
|------|-------|
| Code | `projects_root/<project>/` |
| Context/notes | `.claude/context/projects/<project>.md` |
| Registration | `paths-registry.yaml` → `development.projects` |

### Related Commands

- `/create-project <name>` - Create new code project
- `/register-project <path-or-url>` - Register existing project

## Core Workflow Patterns

**PARC**: Prompt → Assess → Relate → Create (design review before implementation)
**DDLA**: Discover → Document → Link → Automate
**COSA**: Capture → Organize → Structure → Automate
**Agent Selection**: Choose between custom agents, built-in subagents, skills, or direct tools

### PARC Pattern (Apply Before Significant Tasks)

Before implementing any significant task, run a quick PARC check:
1. **Prompt**: What's being asked? (parse the request)
2. **Assess**: Do existing patterns apply? (check `.claude/context/patterns/`)
3. **Relate**: How does this fit the architecture? (scope, reuse, impact)
4. **Create**: Apply patterns, document new discoveries

**Explicit invocation**: `/design-review "<task description>"`
**Full documentation**: @.claude/context/patterns/prompt-design-review.md

---

## Advanced Task Patterns

When handling complex multi-step tasks:

0. **Apply PARC first**: Quick design review - is there an existing pattern? (`/design-review`)
1. **Check for patterns first**: @.claude/context/patterns/
2. **Use structured phases**: Break tasks into Phase 1, Phase 2, etc.
3. **Classify findings**: Use severity system from @.claude/context/standards/severity-status-system.md
   - `[X] CRITICAL` - Immediate action required
   - `[!] HIGH` - Address within 24h
   - `[~] MEDIUM` - Address this week
   - `[-] LOW` - Nice to fix
4. **Store in Memory**: See @.claude/context/patterns/memory-storage-pattern.md for when to store
5. **Document once used 3x**: Create slash command or workflow doc

## Built-in Subagents

Claude Code includes specialized subagents that are **automatically invoked** when appropriate:

### Core Subagents
- **Explore**: Fast codebase exploration, finding files, understanding architecture
- **Plan**: Software architect for designing implementation strategies
- **claude-code-guide**: Documentation lookup for Claude Code, Agent SDK, API questions

### Feature Development (feature-dev plugin)
- **feature-dev:code-architect**: Design feature architectures with implementation blueprints
- **feature-dev:code-explorer**: Analyze existing features, trace execution paths
- **feature-dev:code-reviewer**: Review code with confidence-based issue filtering

### Other Plugins
- **hookify:conversation-analyzer**: Analyze conversations to create prevention hooks
- **agent-sdk-dev:agent-sdk-verifier-py**: Verify Python Agent SDK applications
- **agent-sdk-dev:agent-sdk-verifier-ts**: Verify TypeScript Agent SDK applications
- **project-plan-validator**: Validate project plans against infrastructure patterns

### Custom Agents (via `/agent`)
Your infrastructure-specific agents with persistent memory:
- `/agent deep-research "topic"` - Web research with multi-source validation
- `/agent service-troubleshooter "issue"` - Systematic service diagnosis
- `/agent docker-deployer "service"` - Guided Docker deployment

**Decision Guide**: @.claude/context/patterns/agent-selection-pattern.md

## Session Management

### Starting a Session
1. Check @.claude/context/session-state.md
2. Review any pending work
3. Continue where you left off

### During Work
- Track tasks with TodoWrite tool
- Update context files as you discover information
- Use Memory MCP for decisions and lessons learned

### Ending a Session
Run `/end-session` which will:
- Update session-state.md
- Review and clear todos
- Commit changes if needed
- Push to GitHub if applicable

---

## Memory Usage

### Store in Memory MCP
- **Decisions**: Why you chose one approach over another
- **Relationships**: Service A depends on Service B
- **Events**: When things were installed, migrated, or broke
- **Lessons**: Solutions that worked, patterns to follow

### Store in Context Files
- Detailed documentation
- Step-by-step procedures
- Configuration references
- Troubleshooting guides

### Never Store
- Secrets or credentials
- Temporary states
- Information already in files
- Obvious facts

See @.claude/context/patterns/memory-storage-pattern.md for detailed guidance.

## Available Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/setup` | Initial configuration wizard |
| `/end-session` | Clean session exit |
| `/design-review` | PARC pattern design review |
| `/discover <target>` | Discover and document services |
| `/health-check` | Verify system health |

---

## Agents

Specialized agents available via `/agent`:

| Agent | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `docker-deployer` | Deploy and configure Docker services |
| `service-troubleshooter` | Diagnose infrastructure issues |
| `deep-research` | In-depth topic investigation |

---

## Audit Logging

All Claude Code tool executions are **automatically logged** via the hooks system.

### How It Works

The `.claude/hooks/` directory contains JavaScript hooks:

| Hook | Event | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| `audit-logger.js` | PreToolUse | Logs all tool executions |
| `session-tracker.js` | Notification | Tracks session lifecycle |
| `docker-health-check.js` | PostToolUse | Verifies Docker after changes |
| `project-detector.js` | UserPromptSubmit | Auto-detects GitHub URLs and "new project" requests |

### Log Format

All logs stored as JSONL in `.claude/logs/audit.jsonl`:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-01-01T14:30:00.000Z",
  "session": "Infrastructure Review",
  "who": "claude",
  "type": "tool_execution",
  "tool": "Bash",
  "parameters": { "command": "docker ps" }
}
```

---

## Response Style

- Be concise and practical
- Suggest documenting discoveries
- Ask clarifying questions about paths and preferences
- Think in reusable patterns, not one-off solutions
- Reference context files when giving advice
- Propose slash commands for repeated tasks

---

## Project Status

**Setup Status**: Not yet configured - run `/setup`

After setup, this section will be updated with your configuration details.
