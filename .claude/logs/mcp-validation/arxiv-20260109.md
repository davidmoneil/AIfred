# arXiv MCP Validation Results

**Date**: 2026-01-09
**Status**: PARTIAL (Phase 4 pending restart)
**Tier Recommendation**: Tier 2 (Task-Scoped) — Tentative

## Phase 1: Installation Verification

- [x] MCP registered in Claude (`arxiv` in mcp list)
- [x] Server connected: `uvx arxiv-mcp-server`
- [x] Configuration in ~/.claude.json (project scope)
- [x] No startup errors

**Installation Note**: Initial attempt with `npx -y mcp-arxiv-server` failed (package not found on npm). Switched to Python-based `uvx arxiv-mcp-server` which works.

## Phase 2: Configuration Audit

- [x] No API keys required
- [x] No environment variables needed
- [x] Uses public arXiv API
- [x] Python-based (requires uv/uvx)

**Configuration**:
```json
{
  "type": "stdio",
  "command": "uvx",
  "args": ["arxiv-mcp-server"],
  "env": {}
}
```

## Phase 3: Tool Inventory

Expected tools (from documentation):
| Tool | Purpose | Parameters |
|------|---------|------------|
| `search_papers` | Search arXiv papers | query, max_results |
| `get_paper` | Get paper details | paper_id |

**Tool Count**: ~2-4 (to be verified after restart)
**Token Cost Estimate**: ~2K tokens

### Features (from docs)
- Search arXiv paper database
- Retrieve paper abstracts and metadata
- Access paper content

## Phase 4: Functional Tests

**Status**: PENDING SESSION RESTART

Tools not available until restart (discovered during DuckDuckGo validation).

### Planned Tests (post-restart):
1. **search_papers**: Query "machine learning transformers" → Expect paper list
2. **get_paper**: Retrieve known paper ID → Expect metadata/abstract

## Phase 5: Tier Recommendation

**Recommended Tier**: Tier 2 (Task-Scoped) — TENTATIVE

**Justification**:
- Specialized research use case
- Low token cost (~2K)
- No API key required
- Public arXiv API (should be reliable)
- Enable when doing research/literature review tasks

**Pending Verification**: Tier recommendation contingent on Phase 4 success.

## Overlap Analysis

| Capability | arXiv MCP | Alternative | Preference |
|------------|-----------|-------------|------------|
| Paper search | search_papers | WebSearch | arXiv (structured results) |
| Paper details | get_paper | WebFetch | arXiv (API-level access) |

**Verdict**: arXiv MCP provides unique academic paper access not available through general web search. Recommended for research-heavy sessions.

## Harness Validation Notes

**Discovery**: Package naming varies significantly across MCP ecosystem:
- Documentation often references packages that don't exist
- Python (uvx) vs Node (npx) variants may have different names
- Always verify package exists before adding to config
