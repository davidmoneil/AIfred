# JICM In-Progress State — B.1 claude-code-docs COMPLETE

## Status: B.1 COMPLETE — Needs commit + push to Project_Aion

## What Was Done
1. Forked costiash/claude-code-docs → github.com/CannonCoPilot/claude-code-docs (via API)
2. Refactored fork (install.sh v0.6.0-jarvis, helper scripts, CLAUDE.md) — pushed to CannonCoPilot
3. Created /docs command at .claude/commands/docs.md (project-level)
4. Added docs sync to session-start.sh (git pull on startup, after AIfred sync)
5. Updated: roadmap-ii.md (B.1 DONE), current-priorities.md, session-state.md, SOTA catalog (SOTA-039 → active)
6. Tested: --version, --status, direct doc read all working. Fuzzy search needs CWD fix (minor).
