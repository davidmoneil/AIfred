# External Sources

Symlinks to external data. Never store actual data here.

## Structure

- `docker/` - Links to docker-compose files
- `logs/` - Links to important log directories
- `configs/` - Links to external configuration files

## Adding Links

Use the /link-external command or:

```bash
ln -s /actual/path external-sources/category/link-name
```

Then update paths-registry.yaml.

## Current Links

None yet. Links will be added as external resources are discovered.
